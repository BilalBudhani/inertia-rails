# Inertia.js Rails Adapter

To use [Inertia.js](https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia) you need both a server-side adapter (like this one) as well as a client-side adapter, such as [inertia-react](https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia-react). Be sure to also follow the installation instructions for the client-side adapter you choose. This documentation will only cover the Rails adapter setup.


## Installation


Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'inertia', git: 'https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia-rails/'
```

TODO: Publish to RubyGems!

And then execute:

    $ bundle

~~Or install it yourself as:~~

    $ gem install inertia-rails

## Usage

## Layouts
Inertia Rails automatically uses your default application layout. If you'd like to change that, you can do so via the Inertia config

~~~ruby
Inertia.configure do |config|
  config.layout = 'inertia' # uses layouts/inertia.html.erb
end
~~~

## Making Inertia responses

To make an Inertia response, use the inertia renderer. This renderer takes the component name, and allows you to pass props and view_data as an options hash.

~~~ruby
class EventsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    render inertia: 'Events',
      props: {
        events: Event.all
      }
  end
end
~~~

## Following redirects

When making a non-GET Inertia request, via `<inertia-link>` or manually, be sure to still respond with a proper Inertia response. For example, if you're creating a new user, have your "store" endpoint return a redirect back to a standard GET endpoint, such as your user index page. Inertia will automatically follow this redirect and update the page accordingly. Here's a simplified example.

~~~ruby
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def index
    render inertia: 'Users/Index', props: {users: User.all}
  end

  def store
    User.create params.require(:user).permit(:name, :email)

    redirect_to users_path
  end
end
~~~

Note, when redirecting after a `PUT`, `PATCH` or `DELETE` request you must use a `303` response code, otherwise the subsequent request will not be treated as a `GET` request. A `303` redirect is the same as a `302` except that the follow-up request is explicitly changed to a `GET` request. The gem includes middleware which does this automatically.

## Sharing data

To share data with all your components, use the controller method `inertia_share`. This can be done both synchronously and lazily.

~~~ruby
# Synchronously
inertia_share app_name: env['app.name']

# Lazily
inertia_share do
  if logged_in?
    {
      'auth.user' => {id: logged_in_user.id}
    }
  end
end

# OR
inertia_share user_count: lambda { User.count }
~~~

## Accessing data in root template
There are situations where you may want to access your prop data in your root template. For example, you may want to add a meta description tag, Twitter card meta tags, or Facebook Open Graph meta tags. These props are available via the `page` variable.

~~~erb
<meta name="twitter:title" content="<%= page['props']['event'].title %>">
~~~

Sometimes you may even want to provide data that will not be sent to your JavaScript component. You can do this using the `view_data` option.

~~~ruby
render inertia: 'Event', props: {event: event}, view_data: {meta: event.meta}
~~~

You can then access this variable like a regular erb variable.

~~~erb
<meta name="description" content="<%= meta %>">
~~~

## Asset versioning

One common challenge with single-page apps is refreshing site assets when they've been changed. Inertia makes this easy by optionally tracking the current version of your site assets. In the event that an asset changes, Inertia will automatically make a hard page visit instead of a normal ajax visit on the next request.

To enable automatic asset refreshing, first set up the Inertia config with your current asset version. We recommend putting this in an initializer.

~~~ruby
Inertia.configure do |config|
  config.version = '1.0'
end
~~~

You can also use lazy evaluation.

~~~ruby
Inertia.configure do |config|
  config.version = lambda { Version.last }
end
~~~

## Javacript setup

### Turbolinks

IMPORTANT!! InertiaJS and Turbolinks do not play nicely together since they both intercept AJAX requests. If you want to use InertiaJS, you should leave Turbolinks out of your application.

### CSRF tokens

Under the hood, Inertia uses Axios to make `POST`, `PATCH` and `DELETE` requests. By default, Rails will not trust those requests because Axios does not grab the Rails CSRF token from the page by default.

In order to allow these requests, you must manually configure Axios by adding something like the following to your page's Javascript:

```javascript
window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const csrfToken = document.querySelector("meta[name=csrf-token]").content;
  axios.defaults.headers.common['X-CSRF-Token'] = csrfToken;
});
```

### Example: Using InertiaJS with React via Webpacker

This gem is agnostic about how to use InertiaJS on the client side, but here is an example of how to configure this with React:

Load inertiaJS on page load:

```javascript
// app/javascript/packs/inertia.jsx
import { InertiaApp } from '@inertiajs/inertia-react'
import React from 'react'
import { render } from 'react-dom'
import axios from 'axios';

window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  // Make sure Inertia sends the Rails CSRF token with requests
  const csrfToken = document.querySelector("meta[name=csrf-token]").content;
  axios.defaults.headers.common['X-CSRF-Token'] = csrfToken;

  const app = document.getElementById('app')

  // Configured so that `render inertia: 'SomeComponent'` calls in the controllers
  // will reference components within the `app/javascript/pages` directory
  render(
    <InertiaApp
      initialPage={JSON.parse(app.dataset.page)}
      resolveComponent={name => import(`../pages/${name}`).then(module => module.default)}
    />,
    app
  )
});
```

Include the javascript pack in the application layout:

```html
# app/views/layouts/application.rb
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>InertiajsOnRails</title>
    <%= csrf_meta_tags %>
    <%= csp_meta_tag %>

    <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'application', media: 'all' %>
    <%= javascript_pack_tag 'inertia' %>
  </head>

  <body>
    <%= yield %>
  </body>
</html>
```

Render via inertia in the controller:

```ruby
class HomeController < ApplicationController
  def index
    # Because of the way InertiaJS is rendered above, it will look for this
    # component in `app/javascript/pages/App.js`
    render inertia: 'App',
      props: {
        someData: "Hello World!"
      }
  end
end
```

Define the React Component:

```javascript
// app/javascript/pages/MyPage.jsx
const MyPage = ({ someData }) => <div>{someData}</div>

export default MyPage;
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
